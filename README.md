# HackMTY2019

Project made in 24 hours during the HackMTY: The biggest student hack in Mexico

This project prototypes an anti-phishing app which runs as a VPN in the background.

It has 3 factor security which includes:
Blockada
Google Safe Browsing API
IBM Watson Machine Learning

It also has Smart Message Scanning which fetches emails and sms as they are recieved and checks the validity of the sender, the context and any link it may have. With this the data can be reported to companies if it is found to be fake.
